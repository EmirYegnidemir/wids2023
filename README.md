WiDS Datathon 2023 Kaggle Project - Team Artemis 

## Background on the challenge
Extreme weather events are sweeping the globe and range from heat waves, wildfires and drought to hurricanes, extreme rainfall and flooding. These weather events have multiple impacts on agriculture, energy, transportation, as well as low resource communities and disaster planning in countries across the globe.

Accurate long-term forecasts of temperature and precipitation are crucial to help people prepare and adapt to these extreme weather events. Currently, purely physics-based models dominate short-term weather forecasting. But these models have a limited forecast horizon. The availability of meteorological data offers an opportunity for data scientists to improve sub-seasonal forecasts by blending physics-based forecasts with machine learning. Sub-seasonal forecasts for weather and climate conditions (lead-times ranging from 15 to more than 45 days) would help communities and industries adapt to the challenges brought on by climate change.

## Overview: the dataset and challenge
This yearâ€™s datathon, organized by the WiDS Worldwide team at Stanford University, Harvard University IACS, Arthur, and the WiDS Datathon Committee, will focus on longer-term weather forecasting to help communities adapt to extreme weather events caused by climate change.

The dataset was created in collaboration with Climate Change AI (CCAI). Participants will submit forecasts of temperature and precipitation for one year, competing against the other teams as well as official forecasts from NOAA.

This was my first experience with Kaggle competitions, and I have experimented with data visualisation tools, variety of machine learning methods and libraries (XGBoost, LGBM, SVR, mxnet), and learnt a lot from creative solutions of other teams.
Our team consisted of me and Asst. Prof. Ulya Bayram. We have placed 257th out of 697 teams.
